This is my first JavaScript project. It is a web application that has five buttons:

    Add One: This button adds 1 to the number.
    Add Ten: This button adds 10 to the number.
    Subtract One: This button subtracts 1 from the number.
    Subtract Ten: This button subtracts 10 from the number.
    Reset: This button resets the number to 0.

The application uses JavaScript to update the number in the DOM when a button is clicked.

i'll be so happy if you give a star :)
